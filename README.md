# GPU_ImageFFT
This is the last project for the Coursera Course CUDA at Scale For the enterprise.

I modified the boxFilter lab and added the FFT modifications to boxFilterNPP.cpp

All of the images used by the code were at the level of boxFilterNPP.cpp

In the repo, I placed them in the "images" directory.

FYI: Lena.png was corrupt but lena.pgm was oK
